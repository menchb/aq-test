          AQ Test is an open-source project hosted in <a class="underline underline-offset-4" href="https://github.com/menchb/aq-test">GitHub</a>, starting on July
          27, 2022. It started as the creator's personal project, but contributions were offered, thus growing the project
          further. We took on the challenge to continually add value to AQ Test, all in the motivation of helping people build
          their resilience.
