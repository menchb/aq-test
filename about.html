          AQ Test is an open-source project hosted in <a class="underline underline-offset-4" href="https://github.com/menchb/aq-test">GitHub</a>, starting on July
          27, 2022. It began as the creator's personal project, but contributions were offered, thus growing it
          further. We took on the challenge to continually add value to AQ Test, all in the motivation of helping people build
          their resilience.

          The Adversity Quotient test by Paul Stoltz, Ph.D. is displayed for people to take and find out their scores. Explanation
          is also given after the test to help them understand the core divisions of their adversity response, whether to learn
          how to improve or maintain them.
        </p>

          Further in the website's roadmap, we shall integrate credible blogposts for people to read regarding their adversity quotient.
