## Adversity Quotient (AQ) Test

### Background
The Adversity Quotient is one of the four main quotients types, the others being Emotional Quotient (EQ), Social Quotient (SQ), and Intelligence Quotient (IQ). This project aims to help individuals determine their AQ.

### How it Works
A JSON file consists the 20 questions by Paul G. Stolz, Ph.D. that assess an individual's AQ, as retrieved from [an article from winstonbrill.com](http://www.winstonbrill.com/bril001/html/article_index/articles/501-550/article517_body.html?fbclid=IwAR0eEYokiDxVG0VU0WQNMd3j_qp0qsDJYlqt42w6w5fOdiPiUu9aQblYLmk). The individual visits the deployed website and answers accordingly. Scores are automatically computed and displayed after completion.

### Project Goals
The project itself shall prove useful to people who wish to know their AQ. And in the future updates, the website shall help individuals to improve their scores.
